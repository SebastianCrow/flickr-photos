# FlickrPhotos

A simple Flickr photos app allowing to search for any term from the Flickr (with the default paged filled with "Dogs").
Moreover, it's possible to specify the filters like the color or license type.

After you type the query, just scroll - the next pages will be fetched automatically.

Click on the author name visible in the photos and admire her/his collection of the photos.
Click on the photo to see it in the full size with an additional description.

Have fun!

## TODO

- [ ] Add an offline functionality and an option to add it to the Homescreen (manifest.json)
- [ ] A map of the searched photos
- [ ] A better and justified image grid (a more sophisticated solution than a simple flex grid)
- [ ] Some scroll graphical issues on iOS devices
- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Fix TODOs in the code
